# TODO: use def to define a function called area_of_circle which takes an argument called r

# TODO implement your function to return the area of a circle whose radius is r
# FILE(s): chapter5_assignment.py

# Write a function called area_of_circle, which takes the radius as an argument, and returns the area of the circle
# with that radius.

# As a refresher, the area of any circle is equal to the radius squared, multiplied by pi (where pi is 3.14159....).

# Donâ€™t forget to include the math module, where pi is defined.

# *NOTE -- in the book, you are given some test cases below your function. Do not include those here in Vocareum. Just
# add your function to the chapter5_assignment.py file.
